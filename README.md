### Why I created this project?

Learning is never enough, it is always important to understand something different implemented in the tools of our daily lives, and no project is small enough not to be created. A simple theme can give you an idea, maybe not a big one, but a base, in maybe design and UX, in improving the user experience as well as his vision in the editor and maybe improving his productivity.

### Installation


Vundle: <pre>Plugin 'natanscalvence/PastellGit'</pre>
NeoBundle:  

<pre>NeoBundle 'natanscalvence/PastellGit'</pre>

Manual:
<pre>
cd /etc/vim/
sudo git clone https://github.com/natanscalvence/PastellGit.git
cd PastellGit
mv colors /etc/vim/
</pre>
### Open your vim than type:
